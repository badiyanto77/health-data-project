# Data Engineering Pipeline: Google Drive ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Redshift ‚Üí Power BI  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project implements a **data engineering pipeline** that automates the flow of data from **Google Drive** into **Amazon Redshift** for reporting in **Power BI**.  

The pipeline stages raw files in **Amazon S3**, loads them into Redshift (Bronze layer), and applies transformations into **Silver** and **Gold** tables for analytics. The entire workflow is orchestrated with **Apache Airflow**, first tested locally and then deployed on **Amazon MWAA** (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow).  

The end goal is a **scalable, automated, and production-ready pipeline** that ensures reliable data ingestion, transformation, and reporting.
